                <h5>Here at BYTe, we like to show the public how programming <i>should</i> be. No halfway finished
                    program. No confusion on how to use a tool. No going through each document having to hand-fix a
                    bunch of typos. A program should automate the tedious work, and allow you to focus on the tasks at
                    hand. BYTe encourages that. We put privacy and efficiency first, and ensure everything is secure.
                    Take a look at our core principles.

                    <p class="" id="goals-privacy-description">We. Love. Privacy. Who needs to know what
                        you're doing? Just let us search in peace, right? This is why every program we make aims ensure
                        your privacy. This includes encryption, transferring data in an unusual and confusing way and
                        using WiFi only when necessary. When programmers use the Internet as an core part of their app,
                        this
                        leaves a chance for a hacker to change what gets returned, and potentially ruin your whole
                        computer. BYTe works to protect you against the Internet.

                    <p id="goals-efficiency-description">We strive to put out the best, be the best, and raise the best.
                        Being the best involves being patient, knowledgable and most importantly, being efficient.
                        Efficiency isn't just about being quick. It's being speedy while doing the action correctly and
                        in the most optimized way possible. BYTe tries it's hardest to optimize our code so there are no
                        bugs, it runs quickly and it's easy to understand. This allows you to do focus on what needs to
                        be done, spending less time on the grueling/repetitive tasks.

                        Communication can yield very positive and negative criticism, and BYTe will listen to both. Part
                        of making is program is knowing what works, and what doesn't. While positive feedback is
                        encouraged, negative feedback is <i>sometimes</i> needed. This is because we prefer people using
                        their voices instead saying nothing about very dangerous bug that a hacker could exploit.
                        Sometimes, we even bicker between ourselves! Communication is key when it comes to big projects
                        like this.

                    <p id="goals-efficiency-description">
                        Quality is very important to BYTe. It was one of the reasons why BYTe was founded; low effort
                        programs stink. Here, we try our hardest to make everything accessible to everyone, everywhere
                        on every device.
